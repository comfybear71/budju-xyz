| Spot auto-trade | `api/auto-trade-cron.py` | Every 5 min | CoinGecko prices → Swyftx orders |
| Telegram | `api/telegram-cron.ts` | 4x daily (0/6/12/18 UTC) | Promos, price updates, strategy opportunities |

---

## 3. Current State (as of March 24, 2026)

### What's Working
- Full website with 14 pages, responsive design, dark/light theme
- Spot auto-trader via Swyftx with tier-based settings (T1/T2/T3), circuit breakers, cooldowns
- Perpetual paper trading with $10K virtual balance, 10 markets, up to 50x leverage
- 10 automated perp strategies (3 enabled by default: trend following, mean reversion, momentum)
- Real-time Binance WebSocket price streaming with 3 fallback endpoints
- 6-chart dashboard grid with lazy loading (IntersectionObserver for iOS Safari)
- Inline SL/TP/trigger editing on chart position/order cards
- Pending limit/stop orders with 24h expiry
- Advanced position management: partial close, pyramiding, flipping, core/satellite tagging
- Telegram bot with AI Q&A (Claude Haiku), auto-moderation, interactive menus
- Share-based pool accounting (NAV system) for multi-user fund management
- VPS trading bot on DigitalOcean for on-chain Jupiter DEX trades
- Python test suite (auth, circuit breakers, pool math)

### What's Not Active / Future
- **Drift Protocol live perps** — Code exists in `perp_exchange.py` but deps exceed Vercel 500MB limit. Needs separate infra.
- **NFT minting** — UI exists but no live mint contract
- **Shop checkout** — Product catalog displayed but no payment integration
- **Frontend automated tests** — Only Python tests exist
- **`executeDeposit` in useTrading.ts** — Returns mock tx ID; real deposits use `depositService.ts`

---

## 4. Recent Changes & Fixes (March 14 — April 7, 2026)

### Multi-Tier System + ML Intelligence (April 7) — MOST RECENT

**Multi-Tier Auto-Trader (Spot):**
- Every coin now exists in ALL three tiers simultaneously (was single tier per coin)
- Target keys are compound: `targets["BTC:1"]`, `targets["BTC:2"]`, `targets["BTC:3"]`
- Cooldown keys are compound: `cooldowns["BTC:1"]`, `cooldowns["BTC:2"]`, `cooldowns["BTC:3"]`
- `tierAssignments` changed from `Record<string, number>` to `Record<string, number[]>` (default `[1,2,3]`)
- New defaults: T1 -3%/+10%/5%/12h, T2 -6%/+12%/8%/12h, T3 -10%/+15%/12%/24h
- Backward compat: old single-tier format auto-migrated on load
- Both admin and non-admin views updated for multi-tier display
- Bug fix: `fetchTraderState()` was converting array assignments to strings — fixed to pass through

**UI Improvements (Spot Auto-Trader):**
- Collapsible coin tags in admin tier settings cards (default collapsed, shows count)
- Collapsible monitoring tier sections (both admin and non-admin)
- Non-admin view now shows read-only tier settings cards matching admin layout
- Thin visible scrollbar on tier settings cards (was hidden)
- Fixed progress bar formula: uses reference price approach (`refPrice = buyTrigger / (1 - buyDev/100)`) — bar starts empty on fresh start
- Added purple "open price" badge to coin cards showing the price when targets were set

**Perps ML Intelligence (3 Phases):**
- **Phase 1 — Feedback Loop:** `perp_strategy_performance` collection tracks rolling 20-trade win rate per strategy/market. Auto-disables strategies below 25% win rate (after 5+ trades). Reduces sizing 50% below 35%. Boosts 1.5x above 55%. Called from `close_position()` on every trade close.
- **Phase 2 — ML Signal Classifier:** XGBoost model trained on 228 closed trades + 3256 signals. 78.1% accuracy. Deployed on DigitalOcean (masterhq-dev-syd1, port 8421) as `budju-ml` systemd service. Every auto-trade scored — signals below 55% win probability rejected. Entry reasons tagged with ML score. Graceful fallback if API unavailable.
- **Phase 3 — Regime Detection:** `detect_market_regime()` classifies markets as trending/ranging/volatile using ADX + BB width. `REGIME_STRATEGY_WEIGHTS` table scales strategy sizing per regime. Mean reversion blocked in trends, trend following blocked in ranges.
- **ML Stats UI:** PerpStrategyPanel shows ML Signal Classifier card (accuracy, win rate, approved/rejected counts) and Strategy Performance table (rolling win rates per strategy/market).
- **Telegram Alerts:** All perp trade opens (long/short) and closes (wins/losses) now sent to Telegram with full details (strategy, symbol, size, SL/TP, P&L).

**UI Improvements (Perps):**
- Visible scrollbars on market pills and strategy marquee
- All 11 strategies enabled and running with auto-trading ON

**Issues Encountered & Fixed:**
- `fetchTraderState()` converting `[1,2,3]` arrays to `"1,2,3"` strings — non-admin tier cards showed "0 coins"
- Progress bar using old midpoint formula instead of reference price — showed 30-50% on fresh start
- ML health check (`urlopen` to VPS from Vercel) blocking dashboard load by 3+ seconds — removed, ML stats from DB only
- XGBoost numpy float32 not JSON serializable — cast to Python float
- Ubuntu 24.04 `pip3` blocked system-wide installs — used venv instead

**New Environment Variables:**
- `ML_API_URL` — ML prediction server on DigitalOcean (http://170.64.133.9:8421)

**New Files:**
- `vps/ml/train.py` — XGBoost training pipeline
- `vps/ml/server.py` — Prediction API server
- `vps/ml/requirements.txt` — ML dependencies (xgboost, scikit-learn, pymongo, aiohttp)

**New MongoDB Collections:**
- `perp_strategy_performance` — Rolling win rate per strategy/market
- `perp_equity_curve` — Equity snapshots for equity curve meta-filter

### Auto-Trader Asymmetric DCA Overhaul (April 4-6)
- **Separate buy/sell deviation bands**: Each tier now has independent `deviation` (buy trigger, e.g. -3%) and `sellDeviation` (sell trigger, e.g. +8%). Replaces the old symmetric single deviation.
- **Asymmetric reset logic after BUY**: When the bot buys on a dip, only the buy band ratchets down. The sell band stays anchored at the higher of old target or new calculation. This prevents the old problem where a 1.5% dip buy would set a sell target only 1.5% above the new low — now price must recover meaningfully before any sell.
- **After SELL**: Both bands reset fresh from current price (clean start after profit-taking).
- **Per-tier cooldown selector**: Each tier can independently set 6h, 12h, or 24h cooldown via buttons in admin settings.
- **Coin holding badges**: Auto-trader cards (both admin and user views) now show a blue badge with the quantity held for each coin.
- **New default deviations**: T1 buy -3%/sell +6%, T2 buy -4%/sell +8%, T3 buy -5%/sell +10%.
- **Admin UI**: Two separate sliders (green for Buy Dev 1-15%, red for Sell Dev 2-20%) replace single deviation slider.
- **Backend cron**: `auto-trade-cron.py` updated with matching asymmetric logic — reads `sellDeviation` from DB.
- **UNI added to Innovation tier** in holdings panel. TRX removed (not held).
- **Dependabot disabled**: Removed `.github/dependabot.yml` to stop auto-PRs.
- **SAFETY-RULES.md**: Added mandatory safety protocol to project root.

### NEXT: Phase 4 — Reinforcement Learning Agent (Future)
- Replace fixed strategy rules with a learned trading policy
- Needs custom gym environment simulating the perp trading engine
- Thousands of training episodes with GPU compute
- Highest ceiling but weeks-to-months of development
- Current Phases 1-3 + ML classifier provide ~80% of the benefit
- Let current system accumulate data — retrain XGBoost weekly via `POST /retrain`

### Housekeeping & Docs Reorganisation (March 27)
- Moved all project .md files (except README.md, CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md) into `docs/` folder
- Created comprehensive DigitalOcean VPS reference doc (`docs/DIGITALOCEAN_VPS.md`)
- Cleaned up stale Git branches: deleted merged Claude branches, closed unused Dependabot PRs (#3, #5)
- **Git workflow rule:** Development happens on feature branches → merged to `master` via PR → branch deleted after merge. Only `master` and active working branches should exist.
- **File organisation rule:** Only README.md, CLAUDE.md, HANDOFF.md in root. All other docs go in `docs/`.

### Auto-Trader Sell Execution Fixes (March 23-24)
- Fixed client-side auto-trader failing for minimum order sizes
- Fixed asset ID type mismatches causing coins to silently fail
- Fixed sells not executing after cooldown expires (all tiers)
- Added per-coin diagnostics for failed sells
- Added HYPE to WebSocket and fixed stale price overrides
- Execute trades immediately on price crosses instead of waiting for 3-min interval
- WebSocket prices were being overwritten by stale CoinGecko prices — fixed ordering
- Enabled Telegram notifications for auto-trader BUY orders

### Admin Authentication Overhaul (March 18-20)
- Removed Phantom wallet signing requirement for admin operations
- Removed Ed25519 signature verification from `/api/state`
- Fixed admin signature retry loops and caching issues
- Removed all localStorage usage — everything persists to MongoDB now
- Made tier settings independent with explicit Save buttons per tier

### Live P&L Fix + Strategy Filtering (March 16)
- Fixed unrealized P&L mismatch between account summary and position cards
- Account summary now uses live WebSocket prices (same formula as position cards)
- StrategyMarquee filters out symbols with open positions

### Inline Editing + Critical Fixes (March 14)
- Inline editable trigger/SL/TP on chart cards (click to edit, Enter/Escape/blur to save)
- Fixed TP exits losing money (now fill at TP target price, not mark - slippage)
- Fixed settings persistence (deep-merge for autoTiers instead of $set overwrite)
- Fixed iPhone charts (renamed proxy to `/api/klines`, added staggered loading)
- Fixed chart geo-blocking (Binance.US → OKX → Binance Global cascade)

### EA-Inspired Strategies (March 14)
- Added Keltner Channel, BB Squeeze, Zone Recovery, HF Scalper strategies
- Equity Curve Trading meta-filter
- Smooth martingale option for grid strategy
- Strategy config auto-merge for existing accounts
- UI toggle switches (replaced ON/OFF buttons)

### Failed: Accumulation Sparkline Charts on Holdings Cards (March 24-25) — REVERTED
- **Attempt:** Add sparkline area charts to each holdings card showing coin accumulation over time (e.g. BTC going from 0 → 0.0147)
- **All changes reverted** — 7 commits made, all undone. Zero net change to codebase.
- **Root cause of failure:** The `/api/accumulation` endpoint returns empty because the MongoDB `trades` collection has no data. Trades were done directly on Swyftx, never synced to MongoDB via `/api/trade/sync`.
- **Mistakes made (do NOT repeat these):**
  1. Created an AccumulationSparkline component and wired it up before verifying the API had data — should have checked data availability FIRST
  2. Placed the sparkline as an invisible absolute-positioned background overlay behind card content — completely invisible to the user
  3. Attempted a "live price buffer" approach using WebSocket prices — user wanted accumulation history, not live price charts
  4. When finally using Swyftx order history (which had data), the charts rendered but looked bad — too large, too dominant, wrong visual style
  5. Made 7 incremental commits trying different approaches instead of getting it right once
  6. Did not ask the user to clarify what they wanted when "can't see shit" could have meant many things
- **What would actually work:** Fetch Swyftx order history via `fetchSwyftxOrderHistory()` in tradeApi.ts (this function exists and returns filled orders with coin codes matching ASSET_CONFIG keys). Build running balance client-side. But the chart design/sizing needs to be done carefully — a subtle 20px sparkline looked bad, a 40px one was too dominant. Needs proper UI design consideration.
- **Key data facts:** The `trades` collection in MongoDB is empty. Holdings come from Swyftx `/user/balance/` API (via `/portfolio/` proxy handler). Trade history is available via `fetchSwyftxOrderHistory()` which hits Swyftx `/orders/?limit=N` and filters for status=4 (filled).

## 5. Known Issues & Tech Debt

1. **Drift Protocol live trading blocked** — Deps are 661MB vs Vercel's 500MB limit. Needs separate infra (VPS or dedicated server).
2. **Cron-based trigger monitoring (1-min interval)** — Price can gap past SL/TP between ticks. Real-time WebSocket monitoring would be more reliable but complex.
3. **Bundle size warning** — Main chunk >500KB. Could benefit from more aggressive code splitting.
4. **No frontend automated tests** — Only Python tests exist (auth, circuit breakers, pool math).
5. **Legacy DB name "flub"** — Should be migrated to "budju" for clarity.
6. **No client-side SL/TP pre-validation** — Server rejects invalid values but frontend doesn't show inline errors before submission.
7. **Pending orders UI** — Lacks real-time price display for all markets simultaneously.
8. **HF Scalper position accumulation** — Can generate up to 15 concurrent positions; monitor balance consumption.
9. **Zone Recovery exposure** — 15% equity cap per zone but multiple zones can stress balance.
10. **Equity curve filter cold start** — Needs ~20 cron ticks of data before it activates; new accounts trade at full size initially.
11. **Mock deposit function** — `executeDeposit` in `useTrading.ts` returns fake tx ID.

- **TypeScript runtime:** Auto-detected from `api/*.ts`
- **Headers:** No-cache on all routes (intentional for fresh deploys)
- **SPA catch-all:** `/((?!assets/).*)` → `/index.html`
- **Crons:** Defined in `vercel.json` (see section 2)
- **VPS:** Separate DigitalOcean instance, systemd service, manual deploys via `git pull + systemctl restart`

---

## 11. Next Steps / Roadmap Considerations

1. **Live perpetual trading** — Drift Protocol integration exists but needs non-Vercel infra due to dependency size limits
2. **Frontend tests** — No coverage currently; critical paths (trading, wallet connection) should be tested
3. **Bundle optimization** — Code splitting for the trade module which is the largest
4. **Client-side validation** — SL/TP/trigger values validated server-side only
5. **DB migration** — Rename from "flub" to "budju"
6. **NFT mint launch** — UI ready, needs smart contract
7. **Shop payments** — Product catalog exists, needs payment integration
8. **WebSocket-based position monitoring** — Replace 1-min cron polling for more responsive SL/TP/liquidation
9. **Auto-trader reliability** — Recent fixes (March 23-24) improved sell execution; monitor for regressions
10. **Strategy backtesting UI** — Backend endpoint exists (`/api/perp/backtest`), could add frontend visualization
